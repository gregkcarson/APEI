Amateur Portable Executable Inspection

This is a really basic PE file parser that attempts to print a summary of information regarding a particular PE file provided by the user. Among other things, it will print loaded DLLs, identify code caves, and will search for a function if the name is provided at run-time.

I imagine you may find this useful as a skeleton to expand upon for inserting backdoors into PE files or for malware analysis.
